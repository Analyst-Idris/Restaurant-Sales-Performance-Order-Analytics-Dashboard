## Project Overview

This project delivers a **business-oriented, interactive Power BI dashboard** designed to help restaurant stakeholders gain a clear, data-driven understanding of **sales performance, customer ordering behavior, and revenue drivers**.

Raw transactional data was transformed into actionable insights to support **menu optimization, revenue growth, marketing efficiency, and operational planning**. The solution emphasizes **clarity, interactivity, and executive usability**, leveraging features such as **Power BI bookmarks and page navigation** to enhance decision-making.

## Business Problem

The restaurant lacked a centralized analytics solution, limiting its ability to:

- Identify top- and low-performing menu items  
- Monitor revenue and order trends over time  
- Understand drivers of **Average Order Value (AOV)**  
- Make evidence-based operational and marketing decisions  

---

## Project Objectives

- Track core performance KPIs (**Revenue, Orders, Items Sold, AOV**)  
- Analyze sales and demand trends over time  
- Evaluate performance by menu category and individual items  
- Enable interactive comparison of top- and bottom-performing products  
- Deliver insights that support revenue optimization and operational efficiency  

---

## Key KPIs

- **Total Revenue:** $159.22K  
- **Total Orders:** 5,343  
- **Total Items Sold:** 12,097  
- **Average Order Value (AOV):** $29.80  

---

## Key Insights

### Overall Performance
- Customers frequently purchase multiple items per order  
- A strong AOV indicates clear upselling and bundling opportunities  

### Time-Based Trends
- Daily fluctuations in orders and revenue reveal peak and off-peak periods  
- Revenue closely tracks order volume, confirming customer traffic as the primary revenue driver  

### Category Performance
- Italian and Asian cuisines generate the highest revenue  
- Other categories contribute stable but comparatively lower sales volumes  

### Item-Level Performance (Bookmark-Driven Analysis)
- A small subset of menu items accounts for a disproportionate share of total revenue  
- Some items show high order frequency but low unit prices, suggesting add-on or complementary purchase behavior

## Interactive Features & Dashboard Design

### Power BI Bookmarks
- Dynamically toggle between **Top 10** and **Bottom 10** revenue-generating items  
- Enables rapid identification of best-performing and underperforming products  
- Reduces visual clutter while enhancing executive storytelling  

### Page Navigator (Seamless User Experience)
- Integrated page navigation enables smooth movement across all dashboard pages  
- Improves usability for non-technical stakeholders  
- Creates a guided, presentation-ready analytics experience for decision meetings  

---

## Business Value

- Faster insight discovery  
- Clearer product performance comparisons  
- Improved accessibility and usability for decision-makers

## Strategic Recommendations

### Optimize High-Performing Menu Items
Focus promotions, menu placement, and inventory planning on top revenue-generating products.

### Increase AOV Through Bundling
Pair high-performing main items with low-priced add-ons to drive incremental revenue.

### Target Low-Performance Days
Use historical demand patterns to deploy promotions on low-traffic days.

### Prioritize High-Revenue Categories
Allocate marketing spend toward Italian and Asian cuisines to maximize return on investment.

### Align Operations with Demand Patterns
Adjust staffing and inventory levels based on observed order and revenue trends.
